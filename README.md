#### Description:
When you first enter the site you are greeted with a homepage the display the features of the website and allows you to register or login. When you enter the Register page you need to enter a username and a password and confirm the password to create the account. If you already have an account then you just type your username and password to login.

Once you are logged in you are greeted with 3 cards. One is a line chart of your balance based on the period you choose or a custom period you enter and the account you select or all the accounts then there is a pie chart of all the expenses that also changes based on user preferences. The last card shows how much you spent and what is your current balance and your cashflow (cash account)

Now onto the accounts page. You can add an account and there are 4 types of accounts; general, cash, bank, credit card. Once the account is added you can now add records to the account. But When clicking on the account you get a page which display the name and type of account and the current balance of the account and the percentage increase or decrease of the account over the last 7 days.

you can view the transactions that belong to that account. You can also edit or delete the account but there is a rule you must always have one cash account. Which means that you can’t delete a cash account if it is the last one doing that will give an error message of “you can’t delete the last cash account”

Now to add a record you press the add-record button that is always on display. Now this will direct us to a form to choose first if the transaction is an expense or an income using radio buttons then the account you want to add the transactions to using a dropdown of all the accounts available.

Then you add the amount and optionally a description or a payee. Now we can choose a category. For example Food & Beverages and inside this category there is subcategories which you can choose from like Groceries, restaurants, fast-food or cafes and so with every other category.You can optionally add a sub category but you have to add a main category. Lastly you have to add the Date of the transaction

If you don’t add the record type or the account or the amount or the category or the date, it will give an error that all fields are required.

Now onto the history. In the history transactions are ordered by their dates and the amount is shown in green if the transaction is an income or red if the transaction is an expense. You can also delete or edit a transaction. Now you can filter these Transactions by their record type, category, account, description, payee, start and end date.

For the record type you can choose to filter between expenses or income. For the category you choose a main category and the transactions that have the same category or a subcategory of the main category are filtered, choosing an account from the available accounts will filter the transactions based on the account you need.

Now for the payee and the description you can type a phrase or a word and the transactions will be filtered on the phrases that match. For the start and end date, choosing a start date will show transactions that are in the same day selected or after. Using end date will show transaction that are int the same day or before. And entering the date in both will filter transactions in that period. Finally there is always a count of how many transactions there are and there is a total of the transactions that shows red if negative and green if positive. Both Change dynamically according to the filters added.

For the export page you can choose an account’s transactions or all the accounts’ transactions to be exported to excel if you are someone who likes to use excel for this types of things and calculate more things.


Finally when clicking on the profile button on the top right corner of the page you have two options to either log out or change password. You can change your password by typing the old password and the new password two types to confirm. And like this my project is complete
